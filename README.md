# WARNING: THIS IS EFFECTIVELY A FORKBOMB
Inside [this](https://thedogofchaos.github.io/iframe-abuse/) page are 16 iframes.  

Thanks to some [JavaScript](https://github.com/bryanbraun/infinitely-nested-iframes/blob/5399e03e78c3c0715759f51454043a72521ad470/3.html#L26-L31) from [bryanbraun](https://github.com/bryanbraun), each iframe will create 16 sub-iframes, recursively.

If you have no idea what I mean by 'recursively', then take a look at the page, but exit quickly.

This page was made purely for fun, and I am not responsible for any crashes.
